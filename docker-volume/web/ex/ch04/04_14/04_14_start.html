      <h1>Our trips</h1>
      <p>We have trips worldwide; incredible experiences that will not only provide unique animal interactions but will also introduce you to local heroes that are making a difference in their communities each and every day. Our trips educate and connect you with conservationists that are making changes in small communities. Little steps with huge impacts!</p>

        <h3>Humpback Whales</h3>
        <p>Tonga is a special place to visit - and if you go at the right time, you will be forever changed by seeing these gentle giants swimming with babies and engaging in heat runs. The excitement level is high on this trip; there’s nothing like hearing the song of a humpback whale as he tries to encourage a female to mate with him. Conservation is top priority among the locals, who do their best to ensure that the whales have a safe place to mate and birth.</p>

        <h3>GB Reef</h3>
        <p>Sail to some of the most incredible islands and dive sites in the world. The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living organism, stretching over 2,000 km down the eastern coast of Australia. This trip will allow you to ‘live’ on the reef. We will visit turtle conservatories, shark protected breeding grounds, and you’ll learn about measures that are being taken to preserve this treasure.</p>

        <p>Want to swim with sharks? This trip is for you. We will see tiger sharks, hammerheads, lemons and occasionally whale sharks. Not only will you have a thrill experiencing silent, graceful beauties swim right by you, you will also learn about the importance of sharks. These top-level predators are necessary for a healthy ocean and help keep all the other species healthy as well.</p>

        <h3>Coral Restoration</h3>
        <p>Learn about coral re-growth and restoration. On this trip you will work with a team of coral specialists. You’ll see how they grow and care for the coral polyps, and once they are large enough, how each one is meticulously attached to the reef. You will help our team monitor assess the health of corals at various stages of growth and even be able to attach new coral to help the reef grow!</p>

    <p>MAR has been organizing small ocean wildlife expeditions for 12 years. We keep our groups small to minimize our impact on the areas we visit and to ensure the animals are not stressed or overwhelmed. This also ensures that our guests can maximize time with the animals. Our company is a tight knit group of conservationists and experts in their fields. All of our employees are passionate about wildlife and conservation. We are all marine biologists and ocean aficionados, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share. We consider each other 'Ohana': a Hawaiian term meaning "family". By the end of your journey you will be part of the MAR Ohana. <a href="#">Meet the team</a></p>

  <section class="problem" id="problem">
    <h1>We have a plastic problem</h1>
    <p>Our oceans are facing growing challenges from pollution, habitat loss, development, and climate change. The impact of plastic and micro-plastics to our seas is outrageous and devastating for many species. Learn more about what you can do to stop it.</p>
    <h3>Here are just a few chilling facts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is estimated that by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic mass than fish</li>
      <li>Plastic waste kills up to 1 million sea birds, 100,000 sea mammals, marine turtles and countless fish each year</li>
      <li>80% of all pollution in seas and oceans comes from land-based activities</li>
      <li>It's not just animals: people are consuming micro plastics too. Ewwww!</li>
      <li>A garbage truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every single minute</li>

      <h1>Take action right now!</h1>
      <p>For a healthy planet, we need healthy oceans. Oceans cover 70% of the earth’s surface and they are seriously under threat. We all need to do our part. Here are some things you can do right now:</p>
    </article>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h1>01</h1>
        <h4>Climate change</h4>
        <p>-It's making oceans hotter, promoting acidification, and making it harder for marine life to breathe by reducing dissolved oxygen levels. We can reduce our own carbon footprint and help decelerate climate change by making smart choices about what we eat and how we travel. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>02</h1>
        <h4>Plastic Pollution</h4>
        <p>We can all help by refusing single-use plastics such as straws, cutlery, and food containers. These are in our lives for seconds, but spend centuries circulating in our oceans, causing significant damage. Don’t support businesses that are using single-use plastics. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>03</h1>
        <h4>Sustainable Seafood</h4>
        <p>Do you know where your food is coming from, how and where it is caught? Long line fishing is extremely disruptive to our oceans. It can trap thousands of by-catch animals, and nets are often lost at sea and become death traps for many animals. The practice of over-fishing certain species is creating a huge imbalance in our sea-based populations. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>04</h1>
        <h4>Fisheries subsidies</h4>
        <p>Every year, governments spend billions on fisheries subsidies, the majority of which directly accelerate harmful overfishing. Subsidies lead to too many fishing fleets and vessels that can remain out at sea longer and decimate populations in certain areas. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>05</h1>
        <h4>Marine protection</h4>
        <p>Today, only 2% of our global oceans are protected marine parks. (Remember that the ocean covers 70% of our earth!) Scientists estimate we may need to protect 30% of the oceans to provide properly for the future of ocean wildlife and ocean health. Make sure your representatives know that these issues are important to you! <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>06</h1>
        <h4>Apex predators</h4>
        <p>Our apex predators, like sharks, play a critical role in regulating the eco-system -and they need our help! Sharks are especially vulnerable to overfishing. As a result of fishing pressures, a third of shark species are already threatened with extinction. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>

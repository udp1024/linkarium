        <h3>Humpback Whales</h3>
        <p>Tonga is a special place to visit - and if you go at the right time, you will be forever changed by seeing these gentle giants swimming with babies and engaging in heat runs. The excitement level is high on this trip; there’s nothing like hearing the song of a humpback whale as he tries to encourage a female to mate with him. Conservation is top priority among the locals, who do their best to ensure that the whales have a safe place to mate and birth.</p>

        <h3>GB Reef</h3>
        <p>Sail to some of the most incredible islands and dive sites in the world. The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living organism, stretching over 2,000 km down the eastern coast of Australia. This trip will allow you to ‘live’ on the reef. We will visit turtle conservatories, shark protected breeding grounds, and you’ll learn about measures that are being taken to preserve this treasure.</p>

We will spend 10 days with sharks, mantas, turtles, ocean iguanas and so much more. Learn about the unique conservation efforts and amazing animals found only in the Galapagos.</p>

Not only will you have a thrill experiencing silent, graceful beauties swim right by you, you will also learn about the importance of sharks. These top-level predators are necessary for a healthy ocean and help keep all the other species healthy as well.</p>

You’ll see how they grow and care for the coral polyps, and once they are large enough, how each one is meticulously attached to the reef. You will help our team monitor assess the health of corals at various stages of growth and even be able to attach new coral to help the reef grow!</p>

    <p>MAR has been organizing small ocean wildlife expeditions for 12 years. We keep our groups small to minimize our impact on the areas we visit and to ensure the animals are not stressed or overwhelmed. This also ensures that our guests can maximize time with the animals. Our company is a tight knit group of conservationists and experts in their fields. All of our employees are passionate about wildlife and conservation. We are all marine biologists and ocean aficionados, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share. We consider each other 'Ohana': a Hawaiian term meaning "family". By the end of your journey you will be part of the MAR Ohana. <a href="#">Meet the team</a></p>
